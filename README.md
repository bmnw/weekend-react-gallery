### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate a collection of photos from my life to illustrate how the application displays content. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
